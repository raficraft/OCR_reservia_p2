Warn when the list item marker style of ordered lists violate a given style.

Options: `'consistent'`, `'.'`, or `')'`, default: `'consistent'`.

`'consistent'` detects the first used list style and warns when subsequent
lists use different styles.

## Presets

This rule is included in the following presets:

| Preset | Setting |
| - | - |
| [`remark-preset-lint-consistent`](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-lint/tree/main/packages/remark-preset-lint-consistent) | `'consistent'` |
| [`remark-preset-lint-markdown-style-guide`](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-lint/tree/main/packages/remark-preset-lint-markdown-style-guide) | `'.'` |
| [`remark-preset-lint-recommended`](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-lint/tree/main/packages/remark-preset-lint-recommended) | `'.'` |

## Example

##### `ok.md`

###### In

```markdown
1.  Foo


1.  Bar

## Install

This package is [ESM only][esm]:
Node 12+ is needed to use it and it must be `imported`ed instead of `required`d.

[npm][]:

```sh
npm install remark-lint-ordered-list-marker-style
```

This package exports no identifiers.
The default export is `remarkLintOrderedListMarkerStyle`.

## Use

You probably want to use it on the CLI through a config file:

```diff
 â€¦
 "remarkConfig": {
   "plugins": [
     â€¦
     "lint",
+    "lint-ordered-list-marker-style",
     â€¦
   ]
 }
 â€¦
```

Or use it on the CLI directly

```sh
remark -u lint -u lint-ordered-list-marker-style readme.md
```

Or use this on the API:

```diff
 import {remark} from 'remark'
 import {reporter} from 'vfile-reporter'
 import remarkLint from 'remark-lint'
 import remarkLintOrderedListMarkerStyle from 'remark-lint-ordered-list-marker-style'

 remark()
   .use(remarkLint)
+  .use(remarkLintOrderedListMarkerStyle)
   .process('_Emphasis_ and **importance**')
   .then((file) => {
     console.error(reporter(file))
   })
```
