###### In

```markdown

[foo]: qux
```

###### Out

```text
2:1-2:11: Do not use definitions with the same identifier (1:1)
```

## Install

This package is [ESM only][esm]:
Node 12+ is needed to use it and it must be `imported`ed instead of `required`d.

[npm][]:

```sh
npm install remark-lint-no-duplicate-definitions
```

This package exports no identifiers.
The default export is `remarkLintNoDuplicateDefinitions`.

## Use

You probably want to use it on the CLI through a config file:

```diff
 …
 "remarkConfig": {
   "plugins": [
     …
     "lint",
+    "lint-no-duplicate-definitions",
     …
   ]
 }
 …
```

Or use it on the CLI directly

```sh
remark -u lint -u lint-no-duplicate-definitions readme.md
```

Or use this on the API:

```diff
 import {remark} from 'remark'
 import {reporter} from 'vfile-reporter'
 import remarkLint from 'remark-lint'
 import remarkLintNoDuplicateDefinitions from 'remark-lint-no-duplicate-definitions'

 remark()
   .use(remarkLint)
+  .use(remarkLintNoDuplicateDefinitions)
   .process('_Emphasis_ and **importance**')
   .then((file) => {
     console.error(reporter(file))
   })
```
