[**unified**][unified] plugin to make it a bit easier to create linting rules.

Each rule in [`remark-lint`][lint] uses this project, so see that for examples!

## Install

This package is [ESM only](https://gist.github.com/sindresorhus/a39789f98801d908bbc7ff3ecc99d99c):
Node 12+ is needed to use it and it must be `import`ed instead of `require`d.

[npm][]:

```sh
npm install unified-lint-rule
```

## Use

```js
import {lintRule} from 'unified-lint-rule'

const remarkLintFileExtension = lintRule(
  'remark-lint:file-extension',
  (tree, file, option = 'md') => {
    var ext = file.extname

    if (ext && ext.slice(1) !== option) {
      file.message('Incorrect extension: use `' + option + '`')
    }
  }
)

export default remarkLintFileExtension
```
